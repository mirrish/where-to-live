# where-to-live

Trying to decide where to live? This tool will help you by visualizing where the people you care most about are located!

## How to use

Run `yarn install` to install dependencies. Then you can run `yarn dev` to start the server and browse to http://localhost:3000/.

Add friends and family in persons.json, with a weight-value that corresponds to how often you would like to see them. 10 means all the time and 1 not that often.
Add locations if they are missing in locations.json. The id of the location must be the same as the location specified for the person in persons.json.
